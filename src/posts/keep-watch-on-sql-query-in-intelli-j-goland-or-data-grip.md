Are you an Intellij, Goland or DataGrip User? Like me, are you running the SQL statements every time you want to see the
change reflected on the table?

If Yes, I found a small trick in Intellij and DataGrip that could watch your SQL query results. It was always there but
I overlooked it. Once I discovered it, it changed my life for debugging or development.

It‚Äôs not a trick actually üòÖ but a feature built within the IntelliJ products. It could easily go ignored but let‚Äôs see
how to use it

When you run any query you will see the Result window below:

![Result Window](/images/keep-watch-on-sql-query-in-intelli-j-goland-or-data-grip/result-window.png 'Result Window')

You would see this clock icon in the toolbar that does all the trick. It was always there but I never thought it would
be so useful üòç

When you click on it, the below options would be available. Each choice you select will refresh the query results after
the selected delay.

A small tip to remember is to make sure you ‚ÄúPin‚Äù üìå the result window. When you do it, you could run other queries along
with the watch window.

The below video shows a small demo of this feature. In the demo, I am watching the result of a SELECT query. When I
update a record it is shown in the result window without running the SELECT query again.

`5s` seems long? What if I want to keep the watch period lower than `5s`? You could use the `Custom` option provided.
With
this, you could also monitor your query changes at a 1s rate interval

Well, that's all for this post. I hope next time this small utility will come in handy for you. Don‚Äôt run the query
every time to see the change. IntelliJ tools are a powerhouse of such small utilities which are very easily ignored by
us.

Thanks! and Happy Coding!
